                    <p>Evernote's ownership interests in the Software are protected by United States and other applicable copyright, patent and other laws and international treaty provisions. Except for the limited license rights specifically granted to Licensee in this Agreement, all rights, title and interests, including without limitation intellectual property rights, in and to the Software, including all Derivative Works thereof, (and all copies thereof and related materials that are produced or shipped to Licensee under this Agreement), belong to and shall be retained by Evernote or its suppliers, as applicable. Licensee acknowledges that the development of the Software is an ongoing process and that Licensee and other licensees of the Software benefit from the improvements resulting from such ongoing development. In order to facilitate such ongoing development, Licensee may provide certain suggestions, documentation, materials and other data to Evernote regarding the use, improvement or applications of the Software (the "Contributed Ideas"), and Licensee hereby acknowledges and agrees that all Contributed Ideas may be used by Evernote in the development of the Software and/or related products and services. Unless specifically provided in a writing signed by Evernote and Licensee and specifically relating to the disclosure of any Contributed Ideas, and notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Licensee hereby grants to Evernote the irrevocable, perpetual, nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to disclose, use and incorporate the Contributed Ideas in connection with the development of the Software and/or related products and services, and the demonstration, display, license, reproduction, modification and distribution and sale of the Software and/or related products and services, without any obligation to provide any accounting or other reporting.</p>
                    
                    <h2>4. SOFTWARE SUPPORT; INTERACTION WITH EVERNOTE.</h2>
                    <p>4.1 Support of Licensee. During the term of this Agreement, Evernote shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide technical support of the Software to Licensee according to its then applicable support policies. Such technical support shall be available by email communication in the English language, and any other language that may be available from time to time, during Evernote's regular business hours, subject to further restrictions, which may be set forth at the Evernote Site or otherwise published by Evernote and provided or made available to Licensee.</p>
                    <p>4.2 Information Sharing and Interactions. During installation of the Software and from time to time thereafter when Licensee uses the Software, the Software will send information about the Software and the Individual Computer on which the Software is installed to Evernote. This information includes the version of the Software, the language of the Software (e.g., English, Japanese, etc.), the Internet protocol address of the Individual Computer and the Individual Computer's hardware configuration. Evernote does not use this information to identify personal information regarding Licensee. Evernote does use this information to ensure that Licensee is operating the most current version of the Software and, if there is a newer release of the Software, enable Licensee to download and install the current version appropriate for the Individual Computer. Depending upon the settings in the Software, updates to the Software may be installed automatically without Licensee's separate consent. In addition, Evernote will use the information provided to Evernote to enable interaction of the Individual Computer with the Evernote Service, if Licensee is a Registered User. Licensee may customize the interactions with Evernote through the settings found within the Software to limit or, in certain cases, eliminate such interactions. Evernote will use digital certificates to confirm Licensee's identity for the purpose of enabling standard encryption of content transmitted between Licensee's Individual Computer and the Evernote Service. In an effort to protect the security of such transmissions, Licensee cannot disable the use of such digital certificates in connection with the use of the Evernote Service. By using the Software, Licensee consents to the sharing of the information and interactions described herein and, by using the Software with the Evernote Service, Licensee also consents to the use of information described in the then current Evernote Privacy Policy published at the Evernote Site.</p>
                    
                    <h2>5. TERM AND TERMINATION.</h2>
                    <p>This Agreement shall commence on the earlier date of delivery or download of the Software, shall be confirmed upon and by the installation of the Software on any computer device and shall continue for so long as Licensee complies with the terms herein, subject to termination or expiration in accordance with the terms provided herein. This Agreement shall automatically terminate, without notice, upon any failure by Licensee to comply with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the termination of this Agreement, all licenses and other rights granted to Licensee hereunder shall immediately terminate. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the provisions of Sections 3 (Ownership of Software), 6.2 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 7 (Limitations on Liability), 11 (General Provisions) and this Section 5 shall survive and continue to be legally binding upon Licensee and Evernote.</p>
                    
                    <h2>6. SOFTWARE WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; SOFTWARE WARRANTY REMEDY.</h2>
                    <h3>6.1 Limited Warranty.</h3>
                    <p>Evernote hereby warrants to Licensee that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the functional description applicable thereto at the Evernote Site if used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any applicable directions or requirements in the Documentation. The foregoing warranty is extended to the initial Licensee only, is not transferable and shall be in effect for thirty (30) days immediately following Licensee's receipt of the Software (the "Software Warranty Period"). Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of Evernote and its suppliers and licensors for any breach of this limited warranty will be, at Evernote's option, repair or replacement of the Software, if such breach is reported prior to the expiration of the Warranty Period to Evernote or the Evernote authorized distributor that supplied the Software to Licensee (the "Software Warranty Remedy"). Evernote may require that Licensee return or certify the destruction of all copies of the Software to Evernote or to the authorized distributor in order to receive the designated remedy hereunder. Any replacement Software provided pursuant to this Section 6.1 will be covered by the warranty in this Section 6.1 for the remainder of the original Software Warranty Period or for 30 days from the date on which Licensee receives such repaired or replacement Software, whichever is longer.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.2 Disclaimer of Warranties.</h3>
                    <p>(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 6.1, THE SOFTWARE IS BEING PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND EVERNOTE HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDITION, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, DESIGN, OPERATION OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY EVERNOTE, ITS RESELLERS AND/OR ITS OR THEIR AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES, SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE OR MODIFY THE SCOPE OF THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN. If Licensee's legal jurisdiction provides that a certain implied warranty may not be disclaimed, such implied warranty shall only apply to defects discovered during the period of the express Software Warranty Period provided herein. There is no implied warranty for defects discovered after the expiration of such Software Warranty Period. Some legal jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not apply to Licensee.</p>
                    <p>(b) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 6.1, EVERNOTE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET ALL REQUIREMENTS OF LICENSEE, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL SOFTWARE DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. FURTHER, EVERNOTE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DEFECT OR ERROR RESULTING FROM: (I) THE MODIFICATION, MISUSE OR DAMAGE OF THE SOFTWARE BY PARTIES OTHER THAN EVERNOTE OR PARTIES PERFORMING AS A CONTRACTOR TO, AND AT THE DIRECTION OF, EVERNOTE, (II) LICENSEE'S FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT ALL BUG FIXES OR OTHER DEFECT CORRECTIONS WHICH ARE MADE AVAILABLE BY EVERNOTE, (III) USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTIONS PROVIDED IN THE DOCUMENTATION OR AS PERMITTED BY THIS AGREEMENT, (IV) ANY COMPUTER VIRUS OR (V) ANY DEFECT IN OR FAILURE OF ANY THIRD PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL COMPUTER, EQUIPMENT, NETWORK OR SOFTWARE, OR FOR ANY USER ERROR. EVERNOTE DOES NOT WARRANT AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO NON-EVERNOTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE, INTERNET CONNECTIONS OR CONNECTIVITY OR COMPUTER NETWORKS.</p>

                    <h3>7.2 Limitation.</h3>
                    <p>EVERNOTE PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE TO LICENSEE. IN CONSIDERATION FOR, AND AS A FUNDAMENTAL AND EXPRESS CONDITION OF ENABLING USE OF THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT CHARGE, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EVERNOTE SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT THE SOFTWARE WARRANTY REMEDY. THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE SOFTWARE WARRANTY REMEDY DOES NOT FULLY COMPENSATE LICENSEE FOR ANY OR ALL LOSSES, OR IF EVERNOTE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. SOME LEGAL JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE IF LICENSEE RESIDES IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.</p>
                    
                    <h2>8. COMPLIANCE WITH EXPORT LAWS.</h2>
                    <p>Licensee acknowledges that the Software is subject to laws and regulations of the United States restricting the export thereof to foreign jurisdictions and agrees to comply with all applicable United States and foreign international laws, including, without limitation, the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the Bureau of Export Administration, United States Department of Commerce. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall not download, and if downloaded shall not install or shall immediately uninstall and destroy, the Software if Licensee's download, installation or use of the Software is prohibited under applicable laws. By installing or using the Software, Licensee agrees to the foregoing and certifies that it is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or on any list of countries to which the United States has embargoed goods or on the United States Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nations or the United States Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders.
